  CS-338 Final Project
</h1>
<p>
  This is my final project for CS 338. It is an NBA records database with information gathered within the last 10 years, as of Summer 2020. It was coded using SQL, and the DBMS 
  used was SQLite3. It contains:
  <ul>
    <li>
      results of the regular season standings for the last 10 years 
    </li>
    <li>
      profiles of each team in the NBA
    </li>
    <li>
      information about head coaches for various teams that have held jobs in the NBA over the last 10 years
    </li>
    <li>
      information about the General Managers for various teams that have held jobs on teams in the last 10 years
    </li>
    <li>
      information about NBA Finals results over the last 10 years
    </li>
    <li>
      information about NBA Finals MVPs over the last 10 years
    </li>
  </ul>
  It is worth noting that the information in the database is as accurate as the information that is found on the internet. Data for the 2020 season will also be incomplete 
  as this project was made during July and early August of 2020. Information about the 2020 NBA season has since changed. Data for our database was found using 
  <a href = "https://www.basketball-reference.com/" target = "_blank">Basketball Reference</a> and 
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target = "_blank">Wikipedia</a>. Everything is in second normal form at the very least. Thank you for your time.
