This is my final project for CS 338. It is an NBA records database of the last 10 years, with results of the regular season standings, 
the results of the finals, profiles of each team, profiles of various General Managers that have held jobs on teams in the last 10 years, and 
head coaches as well. Everything is in second normal form at the very least. Thank you for your time.
